    <h1>About Me</h1>

      spending time with my wife, playing video games, reading, and trying new

        <h2>Text Adventure Game</h2>
        For CS 428 I created a Text Adventure game in Java with a group of 5
        people. The engine we created allows players to modify any of the game
        files without recompiling the engine. Players can tweak items, add new
        enemies, or even create an entirely different game. The source can be
        found

        <h2>RHPasswordManager</h2>
        After taking CS 142 I wanted to try making a CLI tool to manage my
        passwords. The passwords are XOR encrypted (lol) and saved to disk. The
        source can be found

        <h2>Poll Jam</h2>
        A few Summers ago I created a website that allowed users to create and
        share polls. The site was built with Vue, PHP (Laravel), and Postgres.
        One of the main motivations for creating the website was to allow anyone
        to quickly make a poll and share it without having to create an account
        or give their email. The source can be found
