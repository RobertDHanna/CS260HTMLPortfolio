    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Robert Hanna and I'm a senior CS student. I love
      spending time with my wife, running, playing video games, reading, and
      trying new foods.
    </p>
    <i>I also really like dogs. :)</i>

        <h2>Text Adventure Game</h2>
        <p>
          For CS 428 I created a text adventure game in Java with a group of 5
          people. The engine we created allows players to modify any of the game
          content without having to touch the engine code. Players can tweak
          items, add new enemies, or even create an entirely different game. The
          source can be found

        <h2>RHPasswordManager</h2>
        <p>
          After taking CS 142 I wanted to try making a CLI tool to manage my
          passwords. The passwords are XOR encrypted (lol) and saved to disk so
          that they can be retrieved during a later session. The source can be
          found

        <h2>Poll Jam</h2>
        <p>
          A few Summers ago I created a website that allowed users to create and
          share polls. The site was built with Vue, PHP (Laravel), and Postgres.
          One of the main motivations for creating the website was to allow
          anyone to quickly make a poll and share it without having to create an
          account or give their email. The source can be found
